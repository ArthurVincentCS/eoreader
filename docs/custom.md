# Custom stacks

Custom products can be created from any stack (and some data) provided by the user. These custom products will work
exactly as usual products, but with the user's metadata.

See [this notebook](https://eoreader.readthedocs.io/latest/notebooks/custom.html) for examples on how custom stacks
are working.

## Custom stack with minimum data

For both SAR and optical stacks, the two minimum keywords to provide are:

- `band_map`: a dictionary mapping the satellite band to the band number (starting to 1, in GDAL style)
- `sensor_type`: Either `SAR` or `OPTICAL` (a string or a SensorType Enum)

```python

from eoreader.reader import Reader
from eoreader.bands.alias import *

custom_prod = Reader().open(
    "stack_path.tif",
    custom=True,
    sensor_type="OPTICAL",
    band_map={
        BLUE: 1,
        GREEN: 2,
        RED: 3,
        NIR: 4
    }
)
```

## Custom stack with full data

If you know them, it is best to give **EOReader** all the data you know about your stack:

- `name`: product name. If not provided, the filename will be used
- `datetime`: product acquisition datetime. If not provided, the datetime of the creation of the object will be used
- `constellation`: product constellation. If not provided, `CUSTOM` will be set. Either a string of a `Constellation` enum.
- `product_type`: product type. If not provided, `CUSTOM` will be set.
- `pixel_size`: product default pixel size. If not provided, the stack pixel size will be used.

For optical products, two additional keyword can be set to compute the hillshade band:

- `sun_azimuth`
- `sun_zenith`

```python

from eoreader.reader import Reader
from eoreader.bands.alias import *

custom_prod = Reader().open(
    "stack_path.tif",
    custom=True,
    name="20200310T030415_WV02_Ortho",
    datetime="20200310T030415",
    sensor_type="OPTICAL",
    constellation="WV02",
    product_type="Ortho",
    pixel_size=2.0,
    sun_azimuth=10.0,
    sun_zenith=20.0,
    band_map={
        BLUE: 1,
        GREEN: 2,
        RED: 3,
        NIR: 4
    }
)
```

## Disambiguate the custom stack

At the heart of EOReader lies the condensed name of a product, to whom refers every file produced.
However, if insufficient data is given at the creation of yuour custom stack, ambiguity can occur if several custom stacks are created in the same second.

To avoid this, if no product type nor constellation is given, the condensed name will be set to the file's filename.

However, if this doesn't please you, there are, several workarounds exist:
- give a datatime and a product type or a constellation
- add an `id` that will be added at the end of your condensed name
- give directly your own custom condensed name via `condensed_name`

```python
>>> from eoreader.reader import Reader
>>> from eoreader.bands.alias import *

>>> custom_prod = Reader().open(
        "stack_path.tif",
        custom=True,
        name="20200310T030415_WV02_Ortho",
        sensor_type="OPTICAL",
        condensed_name="my_wonderful_name",
        band_map={
            BLUE: 1,
            GREEN: 2,
            RED: 3,
            NIR: 4
        }
    )
>>> custom_prod.condensed_name
my_wonderful_name

>>> custom_prod = Reader().open(
        "stack_path.tif",
        custom=True,
        name="20200310T030415_WV02_Ortho",
        datetime="20200310T030415",
        sensor_type="OPTICAL",
        constellation="WV02",
        id="test",
        band_map={
            BLUE: 1,
            GREEN: 2,
            RED: 3,
            NIR: 4
        }
    )
>>> custom_prod.condensed_name
20200310T030415_WV02_CUSTOM_test
```

## Limitations

- âš  For now, stacks must be projected in **UTM** (and orthorectified)
